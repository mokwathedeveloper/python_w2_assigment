# List Manipulation Script

## Purpose
This script demonstrates fundamental list manipulation operations in Python, including creation, appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding element indices.

## Steps Performed
The program performs the following operations on a Python list:
1.  Creates an empty list.
2.  Appends four integer elements (10, 20, 30, 40).
3.  Inserts the value 15 at the second position.
4.  Extends the list with another list containing three integer elements (50, 60, 70).
5.  Removes the last element from the list.
6.  Sorts the list in ascending order.
7.  Finds and prints the index of the value 30.

## How to Run the Script
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing `list_manipulation.py`.
3.  Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python list_manipulation.py
    ```
